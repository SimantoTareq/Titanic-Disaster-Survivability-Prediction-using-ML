##  Titanic Disaster Survivability Prediction using ML




## Tasks:




STEPS

1. Describe the data used and how you got the data.
2. Initial Exploration of the data (print data, visualize data). Find the number of attributes, number of records in the data.
 Also, find if there is any attribute that has missing data.
3. Find correlation of data attributes and target variable (whether survived or not) to explore which attributes have the most effects on output (target variable).


4. Compute any new attribute/feature from existing attributes.
    
5. Select your classification model (try at least three model to find best one)
6. Calculate confusion matrix and show classification report using Scikit-learn
    library
7. Perform cross-validation of training data in all cases and run test data to decide
which model is best. 

8. Try techniques like Grid Search etc. Examine whether fine-tuning improve your
prediction performance.
